Podcasts Export App
===================

A macOS app that exports apple podcasts to a folder, for later use on a portable mp3 player.

Following the creation of my [automator script](https://github.com/douglas-watson/podcasts_export), many people struggled to install or use it, due to python dependencies. This project is an attempt to help those people by distributing a proper app. If all goes well, it should install like any other macOS app.


ðŸŽ† New features ðŸŽ†
-----------------

Compared to the automator script, this app allows you to select which downloaded episodes to export. Helpful for large collections.

This one is launched like a regular app, it is no longer registered as a service available from Podcasts.
